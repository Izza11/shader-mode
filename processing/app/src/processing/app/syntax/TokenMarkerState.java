/**
 * This class serves only as a workaround to preserve API and should be removed
 * in the next major version. Base TokenMarker which serves as superclass for
 * token markes for various modes is stateful, but single instance was shared
 * between all tabs and Editors. This caused inherent bugs by leaking state
 * between contexts.
 *
 * TokenMarker subclasses now serve two purposes: they keep keyword list and
 * they override markTokensImpl to provide the marking logic.
 *
 * Since each tab and Editor should have it's own token marker state, I extracted
 * most of the fields and associated metods working with them from TokenMarker
 * into this class, and allowed TokenMarker to create instances of this class
 * when requested.
 *
 * The way marking logic is handled is unfortunate, since markTokensImpl is
 * expected to call addToken() of TokenMarker superclass instead of â€“ for
 * example - returning a List of tokens. I worked around this by plugging in
 * TokenMarkerState instance as listener before markTokensImpl is called.
 * This behavior is safe since TokenMarker is always operated from Event
 * Dispatch Thread and no multithreading is involved.
 *
 * This allows having only single instance of TokenMarker in a way it was
 * intended before while keeping state separate for each tab.
 *
 * In the next major version TokenMarker shound be redesigned with following
 * requirements in mind:
 * - Single instance of keyword list and other common data, initialized by Mode
 * - Each tab should have its own instance of TokenMarker containing its state
 * - Support multiple flavors for different doc types
 * - Other modes should provide logic in a way which is compatible with
 *     multiple states (pure function? Function object?).
 *     Currently state, logic and keywords list are tied together into one
 *     TokenMarker instance, which leads to need for this workaround.

     * This is a foul hack. It stops nextLineRequested
     * from being cleared if the same line is marked twice.
     *
     * Why is this necessary? It's all JEditTextArea's fault.
     * When something is inserted into the text, firing a
     * document event, the insertUpdate() method shifts the
     * caret (if necessary) by the amount inserted.
     *
     * All caret movement is handled by the select() method,
     * which eventually pipes the new position to scrollTo()
     * and calls repaint().
     *
     * Note that at this point in time, the new line hasn't
     * yet been painted; the caret is moved first.
     *
     * scrollTo() calls offsetToX(), which tokenizes the line
     * unless it is being called on the last line painted
     * (in which case it uses the text area's painter cached
     * token list). What scrollTo() does next is irrelevant.
     *
     * After scrollTo() has done it's job, repaint() is
     * called, and eventually we end up in paintLine(), whose
     * job is to paint the changed line. It, too, calls
     * markTokens().
     *
     * The problem was that if the line started a multiline
     * token, the first markTokens() (done in offsetToX())
     * would set nextLineRequested (because the line end
     * token had changed) but the second would clear it
     * (because the line was the same that time) and therefore
     * paintLine() would never know that it needed to repaint
     * subsequent lines.
     *
     * This bug took me ages to track down, that's why I wrote
     * all the relevant info down so that others wouldn't
     * duplicate it.
